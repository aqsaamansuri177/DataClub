Challenge Question: Create a comprehensive hospital performance dashboard using CTEs. Calculate: 1) Service-level metrics (total admissions, refusals, avg satisfaction), 2) Staff metrics per service (total staff, avg weeks present), 3) Patient demographics per service (avg age, count). Then combine all three CTEs to create a final report showing service name, all calculated metrics, and an overall performance score (weighted average of admission rate and satisfaction). Order by performance score descending.

Query:

    SELECT
        service,
        SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_admissions,
        SUM(patients_refused) AS total_refusals,
